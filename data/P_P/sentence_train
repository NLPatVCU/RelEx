1 CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE  The patient was taken to Cardiac Catheterization where she was found to have two vessel disease 
5 HEMATOLOGY  The patient was discharged on Coumadin for apical akinesis and stroke risk 
Abdomen  Soft  nontender  nondistended  good bowel sounds 
She was found to have an ejection fraction of 3035 as well as an akinetic apex and apical mid and septal akinesis 
Given the fact that the patient had significant apical akinesis  she was started on heparin with a transition to Coumadin for anticoagulation for stroke prevention in the setting of apical akinesis 
The patient was found to have 5057 E Sixth Blvd elevations in I  aVL  and V1 through V2 and ST depressions in II  III  and aVF 
The patient also had proximal RCA lesion of 80 and a mid RCA lesion of 8090 which were not intervened upon 
Given the fact that the patient had issues with muscle cramping with Atorvastatin in the past  she was started on Pravastatin which should give less of these side effects 
The patient is a 57  yearold female with a history of hypertension and hypercholesterolemia but no prior coronary artery disease history who presented with chest pain

The patient is a 57  yearold female with a history of hypertension and hypercholesterolemia but no prior coronary artery disease history who presented with chest pain 
The patient will followup with Cardiology in one months time for further management of her coronary artery disease and further evaluation of her remaining RCA lesions

At the time of transfer  he was initially admitted to the CMI Service after undergoing cardiac catheterization which revealed a long LAD lesion that was angioplastied without stent placement  and a total occlusion of the RCA with collaterals 
He subsequently became hypotensive and bradycardiac in the Catheterization Laboratory which responded to IV fluids  dopamine  Atropine  and he was then transferred to the CCU for further monitoring 
As summarized above  the patient had a nonST elevation MI with evidence of an 80 percent mid LAD lesion for which he underwent angioplasty without stent placement
