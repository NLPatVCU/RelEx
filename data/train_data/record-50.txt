4. Terazosin 1 mg p.o. q. day .
SOCIAL HISTORY :
The patient lives alone .
Has a remote tobacco history .
No ethanol .
FAMILY HISTORY :
Positive for diabetes .
No coronary artery disease .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
On admission , blood pressure 151/61 , heart rate 75 , SaO2 93% on room air .
In general , patient in no acute distress .
Speaks in full sentences .
Neck :
Jugular venous pressure notable at the mid neck upright about 80 degree angles .
Cardiovascular regular rate and rhythm with a 1-2/6 holosystolic murmur .
Pulmonary :
Crackles bilaterally one-third to one-half the way up .
Abdomen :
Bowel sounds positive , soft , non-tender , non-distended .
Extremities :
1+ lower extremity edema .
LABORATORIES ON ADMISSION :
Included normal CBC , BUN 47 , creatinine 2.4 up from baseline of about 1.5 .
Troponin 4.7 , CK 101 , MB 3 .
RADIOLOGY :
Chest x-ray showed patient was in congestive heart failure .
ELECTROCARDIOGRAM :
Showed normal sinus rhythm at 107 beats per minute with left axis deviation and poor R-wave progression .
However , no acute changes were apparent .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was admitted to the Cardiac Medicine Service and treated for presumed diastolic and systolic dysfunction .
Echocardiogram was obtained which showed moderately depressed left ventricular systolic function as well as hypokinesis of the lower half of septum and apex .
Also of note was the distal lateral wall hypokinesis .
The wall motion abnormalities were noted to be new .
It was believed that a troponin on admission in addition to the wall motion abnormalities she underwent a non-Q wave myocardial infarction prior to resulted in her current cardiac failure .
Throughout hospital course patient 's troponin trended down to less than 0.3 .
Heart Failure Service was involved .
She was continued with aggressive diuresis .
She was started on _________ with excellent diuresis , however , her renal functioning worsening .
A cardiac catheterization was deferred until the renal issue could be resolved .
However , her creatinine continued to increase .
Diuresis was halted and without improvement in creatinine .
Renal was consulted .
A renal ultrasound was obtained .
It showed a right kidney size of 6.3 cm and a left kidney size of 8.4 cm .
Given her hypertension which was very difficult to control , it was felt that she had renal artery stenosis and thus she underwent MRA of the kidney which showed severe right renal artery stenosis at its origin .
There was also moderate to severe focal stenosis of the left renal artery approximately 1.3 cm from its origin .
Dr. ______________ consulted on the case .
She was transferred to the unit overnight to assess volume which was noted to be optimal .
On 05-25 she underwent catheterization and subsequent stenting of the left renal artery .
Due to dye load required to assess the coronary disease were not visualized .
After the procedure the patient did well .
However , her creatinine has worsened up to 4.2 .
However , her urine output has improved .
She has not required hemodialysis at this time .
She will need close follow up of her renal functioning .
The patient is discharged to an extended discharge facility .
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES :
1. Non-Q wave myocardial infarction .
2. Systolic and diastolic congestive heart failure .
3. Bilateral renal artery stenosis status post stent left renal artery .
4. Acute renal failure .
5. Hypertension .
FOLLOW UP :
She is to follow up with her primary care physician in one week .
She is to follow up Heart Failure and Cardiology in one week as well .
In addition , patient is to have her own appointment with Podiatry .
