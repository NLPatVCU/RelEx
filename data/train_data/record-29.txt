Electrocardiogram :

HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was a direct admission to the operating room on 02-12 , at which time she underwent an
aortic valve replacement .
Please see the operative report for full details .
In summary , she had an aortic valve replacement with a #21 mosaic porcine valve .
She tolerated the operation well , and was transferred from the operating room to the Cardiothoracic Intensive Care Unit .
The patient did well in the immediate postoperative period , however , her blood pressure remained somewhat labile .
Therefore , she was continued on a Neo-Synephrine drip to maintain a systolic blood pressure greater than 110 .
In addition , she was slow to awaken after her anesthesia was reversed , and in several attempts to wean from the ventilator , she developed a respiratory acidosis .
She therefore remained on the ventilator throughout the day of postoperative day one .
On postoperative day two , the patient remained hemodynamically stable .
Her Neo-Synephrine drip was weaned to off .
She was again weaned from the ventilator , and successfully extubated .
Her chest tubes were discontinued and , at the end of the day , she was transferred from the Cardiothoracic Intensive Care Unit to the floor for continuing postoperative care and cardiac rehabilitation .
After being transferred to the floor , the patient did well .
Over the next several days , her activity level was increased with the assistance of Physical Therapy and the nursing staff .
She remained hemodynamically stable .
Her respiratory condition remained stable and , on postoperative day four , she was deemed stable and ready to be transferred to rehabilitation for continuing postoperative care and physical
therapy .
At the time of transfer , the patient 's physical examination is as follows :
Vital signs :
Temperature 98.4 , heart rate 78 and sinus rhythm , blood pressure 106/50 , respiratory rate 18 , oxygen saturation 97% on room air .
Weight preoperatively was 67 kg , at discharge is 70.9 kg .
Laboratory data on 02-15 :
White count 4.1 , hematocrit 23 , platelets 144 .
