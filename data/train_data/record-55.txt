CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST
Reason : STUCK BY AUTO
UNDERLYING MEDICAL CONDITION :
56 year old man s/p struck by auto
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION :
eval for bleed
CONTRAINDICATIONS for IV CONTRAST : None .
INDICATION : Struck by car .
COMPARISONS : None .
TECHNIQUE : Axial MDCT images of the brain without IV contrast .
FINDINGS : There is a linear nondepressed right temporal calvarial fracture extending into the mastoid process .
There is a small subdural hematoma with components of pneumocephalus tracking from the mastoid air cells .
There is no shift of normally midline structures .
There is also a left occipital scalp contusion but no associated skull fracture .
Prominent sutures in this young patient , the right calvarial suture extending into the right temporal bones appears more prominent than its counterpart on the left , however , does not appear to represent an acute fracture .
No other acute fractures are appreciated .
There is small amount of mucosal thickening in the sphenoid sinuses .
No air-fluid levels to suggest occult facial fractures .
Orbits are unremarkable .
IMPRESSION : Linear right temporal calvarial fracture extending into the mastoid process with small associated right posterior convexity subdural hematoma and pneumocephalus .
Discussed with trauma team during the study .
CT C-SPINE W/O CONTRAST
Reason : STUCK BY AUTO
UNDERLYING MEDICAL CONDITION :
56 year old man s/p struck by auto
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION :
eval for fx
CONTRAINDICATIONS for IV CONTRAST : None .
INDICATION : 18-year-old hit by car .
Head injury to the occiput .
COMPARISONS : None .
TECHNIQUE : Axial MDCT images of the cervical spine with coronal and sagittal reformats without IV contrast .
FINDINGS : C1 through T1 are well visualized .
There is normal alignment of the cervical vertebral bodies without acute fracture or traumatic malalignment .
The posterior elements are intact .
There is no significant prevertebral soft tissue swelling .
The C1-C2 relationship is within normal limits .
The dens is intact .
The lung apices are clear without pneumothorax .
The upper ribs are intact .
There is a linear right temporal calvarial fracture extending into the right temporal bones .
This appears to stop short of the carotid canal .
Multiple posterior right - sided mastoid air cells are opacified with blood .
IMPRESSION :
1) No acute cervical spine fracture .
2) Linear right temporal calvarial fracture extending into the mastoid with a small right posterior convexity subdural hematoma and pneumocephalus ; see head CT report .
CHEST ( PA & LAT )
Reason : Please r/o acute process .
UNDERLYING MEDICAL CONDITION :
17 year old man with post-op fever .
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION :
Please r/o acute process .
INDICATION : Postoperative fever .
COMPARISONS : Comparison is made to 2015-10-27 .
TECHNIQUE : PA and lateral views of the chest .
FINDINGS : The heart is of normal size .
Mediastinal and hilar contours are within normal limits .
The lung fields are clear .
There are no pleural effusions or focal consolidations .
There is no evidence of CHF .
IMPRESSION : No evidence of significant abnormality .
TIB / FIB ( AP & LAT ) SOFT TISSUE
Reason : eval for alignment , post op changes
UNDERLYING MEDICAL CONDITION :
56 year old man with open RLE fx now s/p fixation
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION :
eval for alignment , post op changes
INDICATION : Fracture . Assess for alignment .
RIGHT TIBIA / FIBULA , AP AND LATERAL VIEWS : An intramedullary rod is seen fixating a proximal diaphyseal comminuted tibial fracture with six proximal and two distal screws .
Additionally , a side plate is seen medially fixating the fracture .
There is a non-displaced comminuted fracture of the proximal fibular diaphysis .
There is surrounding soft tissue swelling .
Os trigonum is visualized .
IMPRESSION : Comminuted proximal tibiofibular fractures status post ORIF of the tibia with an intramedullary rod and side plate .
No evidence of immediate hardware complication .
CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST
Reason : follow up ct
UNDERLYING MEDICAL CONDITION :
17 year old man with pneumocephalus s/p CMED CCU v. mvc
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION :
follow up ct
CONTRAINDICATIONS for IV CONTRAST : None .
CLINICAL HISTORY : History of pneumocephalus status post pedestrian versus motor vehicle collision .
Follow up CT scan .
COMPARISON : Non-contrast head CT from 2015-10-27 .
TECHNIQUE : Non-contrast head CT .
FINDINGS : The previously noted subdural hemorrhage in the right posterior fossa appears less conspicuous .
The pneumocephalus adjacent to the linear skull fracture appears to have decreased in size .
There are persistent bifrontal and right parietal hemorrhagic contusions with surrounding edema and possible small left frontal subarachnoid hemorrhage ( adjacent to falx ) which are largely unchanged .
There is no shift of normally midline structures or hydrocephalus .
The ventricles , cisterns and sulci are normal .
The air- fluid level in the right sphenoid sinus and bilateral opacification of the mastoid air cells are unchanged .
IMPRESSION :
1. Decreased size of right posterior subdural hemorrhage .
2. Multifocal hemorrhagic contusions and surrounding edema are largely unchanged .
Brief Hospital Course :
He was admitted to the trauma service . Orthopedics and Neurosurgery were consulted because of his injuries .
His Neurosurgical issues were nonoperative ; he was loaded with Dilantin ; serial head CT scans were performed and were stable .
He will need to follow up with Dr. Mckinney in 4 weeks for repeat head imaging and continue with Dilantin for one month .
His right tib / fib fracture was repaired by Orthopedics on 10-27 ; postoperatively there were no complications .
Weight bearing status was increased to weight bearing as tolerated .
He was fitted with a hinged Mcdonald brace for his LLE .
He will need to continue on Lovenox injections for at least 4-6 weeks .
He was transfused with 3 u packed cells for a hematocrit of 21 , post transfusion HCT was 26.1 ; there was a questionable transfusion reaction at the end of his first unit of packed cells ; he did subsequently receive the remaining 2 units without any further reaction .
Physical and Occupational therapy were consulted and have recommended home with services .
