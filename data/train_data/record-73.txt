Brief Hospital Course :
55 year old man with history of metastatic bladder cancer and recurrent DVT s on Lovenox admitted with lower GI bleeding .
Right lower quadrant source of bleed on red blood cell scan .
Attempts to visualize colon by conventional and CT virtual colonoscopy failed because of sigmoid angulation and inadequate preparation , respectively .
On Ct scan , a right psoas mass , most consistent with a hematoma , was seen .
Since the hematocrit of the patient was stable and outside records from 2015-03-28 mentioned a mass in the right pelvis , the patient was discharged .
Lovenox was held until follow-up with primary care doctor .
Also , a repeat outpatient CT colonoscopy with better preparation should be considered .

Discharge Instructions :
We recommend that you do NOT resume your lovenox until talking to your PCP , Dr. Jessie .
You likely have a bleeding source in your colon that we have been unable to visualize .
The bleeding has stopped and you have remained hemodynamically stable and your hematocrit is stable , but you are at risk of bleeding from this source again with anticoagulation .
A CT scan of your abdomen showed a right pelvic mass , most likely a hematoma , which had been described previously in 2015-03-28 .
Please continue to take your other medications as prescribed .
Please follow up with your PCP as scheduled .
Please bring your outpatient lab results to your PCP ( Dr. Hemler )
Please see a doctor if you feel dizzy , or have blood in your stool again .
Followup Instructions :
Please follow up with your PCP S. Saracino on 2015-12-30 at 8:00 AM .
Her number is ( 512 ) 677-6547 .
Please go to Dr. Colombo office later this week to have your labs drawn and sent to Dr. Powell .
