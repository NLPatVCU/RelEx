****************
IMAGING :
2017-08-14 CXR :
ETT in correct position .
PM wires in good position .
S/p right pneumonectomy .
Blunting of left CPA likely effusion .
New lower left lateral CW opacity , likely loculated pleural fluid .
2017-07-19 ECHO :
Left-to-right shunt across the interatrial septum .
LVEF 25% .
Resting WMA include mid to distal septal akinesis , apical akinesis , inferior akinesis/hypokinesis , and mid to distal anterolateral hypokinesis / akinesis .
No definite apical thrombus seen ( cannot exclude ).
01-22+ AR .
Trivial MR .
1+ TR .
2017-08-16 CT head :
New rounded low-density area measuring 2.5 cm in left basal ganglia , which partially extends to the left thalamus , probably representing subacute infarction .
On this head CT without contrast , the evaluation is limited .
2017-08-16 CTA chest :
No evidence for pulmonary embolism .
Findings consistent with failure or fluid overload .
Development of small loculated pleural fluid collection along the periphery of the left major fissure or so-called pseudotumor , consistent with the recent chest x-ray .
Unchanged appearance of right pneumonectomy .
2017-08-16 ECHO :
The left atrium is normal in size .
Overall LVEF is difficult to assess due to poor echo windows although the basal LV appeas hyperdynamic without regional contraction abnormality ( suspect significant improvement compared to prior study dated 2017-07-18 ).
No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle ( due to poor echo windows cannot fully exclude ).
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated .
There is no aortic valve stenosis .
Mild ( 1+ ) aortic regurgitation is seen .
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen .
The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests impaired relaxation .
There is a small pericardial effusion .
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade
2017-08-17 EEG :
Markedly abnormal portable EEG due to the voltage suppression over the left hemisphere and due to the bursts of generalized slowing and right hemisphere slowing .
The first abnormality raises the possibility of material ( such as subdural fluid ) interposed between the brain and recording electrodes or widespread cortical dysfunction on that side .
Anatomic correlation would be of interest if clinically indicated .
The generalized slowing indicates a non specific dysfunction in midline structures .
There was also evidence of subcortical dysfunction on the right side .
No epileptiform features were seen .

Brief Hospital Course :
Mr. Lockley was admitted with respiratory failure , thought to be related to mucus plugging as well as a pseudomonal pneumonia .
Both of these etiologies were treated , and he continued to oxygenate and ventilate well on his usual ventilator settings .
However , the issue that dominated the admission was his recent acute decline in mental status .
He was thoroughly evaluated by neurology and underwent head CT , MRI , LP , and EEG .
This work-up demonstrated a small left basal ganglia infarct , likely cardioembolic .
However , they felt this event could not account for his new , severe global deficit ; this was thought to be secondary to a more pervasive process , likely anoxic encephalopathy , for which the prognosis is extremely grim .
This was discussed at length in several family meetings involving the patient 's wife , son , primary care doctor , ICU attending , and neurology consultant in the presence of a Asian interpreter .
The end result of these discussion was that the patient 's wishes would not be consistent with this new level of functioning from which he had little hope of recovery ; the family decided to make him comfort measures only .
He was disconnected from the ventilator and all medications beyond a morphine drip were stopped , and he expired shortly thereafter .
The family was present .
