She notes that she has had this pain since Thursday , and that it becomes much worse within 15 min of consuming a meal .
She has also had intermittent post-prandial nausea / satiety for which she had been scheduled for an outpt EGD with GI on 2/8 .
She describes the pain as band-like / radiating to both sides but not the back .
Her pain currently is 5/10 .

Pt was seen by GI on 13 EGD was performed HD2 which was negative for gastritis , stricture or ulcer .
Pt was found to be H. Pylori positive and therefore was started on empiric treatment .
Afferent limb of the roux en y anastamosis was visualized however the efferent limb could not be explored .
Pt had HIDA scan which was negative for obstruction , and CT was unremarkable .
Pt was tolerating regular diet by HD4 , and GI felt that further workup could be continued as an outpatient .
Pt was therefore discharged home in stable condition , voiding , ambulating and eating without difficulty .
Plans to follow up with outpatient MRA to rule out ischemic causes of post prandial pain , as well as HIDA with CK challenge to evaluate for biliary dyskinesia without stasis .
Pt will finish course of H. pylori treatment as well .
ADDITIONAL COMMENTS :
If fevers , chills , nausea , vomiting , diarrhea , increasing pain with food please call Dr. Gaetzfreierm &apos;s office or PCP .
