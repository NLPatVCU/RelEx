Pertinent Results :
CNIS 10-29 :
1. 60-69% stenosis of the right internal carotid artery .
2. 80-99% stenosis of the left internal carotid artery .
Echo 11-02 : PRE-BYPASS : Left ventricular wall thickness , cavity size , and systolic function are normal ( LVEF>55% ).
Resting regional wall motion abnormalities include mild apical hypokinesis .
The aortic valve leaflets ( 3 ) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation .
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation .
There are complex (> 4 mm ) atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta .
Mild tricuspid regurgitation .
POST-BYPASS : Preserved Kindred / North Shore - ventricular systolic fxn .
Trivial MR .
Edith AI .
Aorta intact .
CT 11-04 : No acute intracranial hemorrhage .
Findings consistent with small vessel ischemic changes .
MRI would be more sensitive for the detection of acute infarction .
CT angiogram demonstrates no stenosis or aneurysm in the intracranial circulation .
Slight irregularity of the origin of the right vertebral artery may be atherosclerotic in nature .
Normal contrast enhancement seen in the left common/internal carotid artery stent .
Mild stenosis of the proximal right internal carotid artery .
4 mm left upper lobe lung nodule .
In the absence of history of malignancy , this is statistically benign .
One-year followup may be considered .
CXR 11-06 : Allowing for technical changes , no major adverse interval change has occurred .
Bibasilar subsegmental atelectasis together with bilateral pleural effusions appear relatively unchanged .
The mediastinum appears unchanged .
Left-sided subclavian line is unchanged in position .
There is evidence of prior cardiac surgery .

Brief Hospital Course :
Ms. Bridge was admitted from OSH for coronary artery bypass surgery .
She underwent usual pre-operative testing along with carotid ultrasound .
CNIS revealed carotid stenosis and she ultimately underwent left carotid stenting by vascular surgery on 10-30 .
Please see report for details .
On 11-02 she was brought to the operating room where she underwent a coronary artery bypass graft x 2 .
Please see operative report for surgical details .
She tolerated the procedure well and was transferred to the CSRU for invasive monitoring in stable condition .
Later on op day sedation was weaned , she awoke neurologically intact and was extubated .
On post-op day one chest tubes were removed and beta blockers and diuretics were initiated .
She was gently diuresed towards her pre-op weight .
Also on this day she was transferred to the SDU .
Early on post-op day two Ms. Bridge had an episode of aphasia .
She underwent an immediate head CT and Neuro consult and was transferred back to the CSRU .
CT was negative and she returned to baseline neuro status without deficits by arrival to CSRU .
Neurology concluded episode was most concerning for TIA .
Epicardial pacing wires were removed on post-op day four .
After remaining stable in the CSRU for several days without change in neuro status she was transferred back to the SDU on post-op day four .
She was then started on Heparin with transition to Coumadin ( goal INR of 2-3 secondary to h/o bilateral DVT 's).
During entire post-op course she was followed by physical therapy for strength and mobility .
She continued to improve steadily over the next several days without any other post-op 
complications .
She was discharged on post-op day 11 .
