03-07 wound swab : VRE
CT Abd 02-21 :
1. Markedly dilated colon throughout ascending , transverse , and descending colon with air-fluid levels , overall unchanged since prior study performed on the same day with pneumatosis in the ascending colon .
Sigmoid diverticulosis with focal narrowing of the sigmoid colon just distal to the dilatation with wall thickening , due to diverticulitis .
This area can be a leading point of obstruction .
An underlying mass lesion or cancer cannot be excluded in this area , and further clinical investigation is recommended .
2. Limited evaluation for known sigmoid-vesicle fistula .
3. Small amount of ascites , somewhat increased anterior to the liver .
4. Bilateral renal cysts .
5. Heavy calcification of the aorta and SMA and its branches .
Due to atherosclerosis , assessment of the intraluminal process of these branches is limited .
CTA/CT abd 03-07 :
1. No evidence of pulmonary embolism .
Small bilateral pleural effusions with compressive atelectasis .
2. Left lower quadrant thick-walled peripherally enhancing fluid collection , which appears to communicate with the sutured end of the proximal sigmoid colon via a small collection of extraluminal gas .
In the correct clincial setting , this could be consistent with an abscess .
3. Moderate intraabdominal ascites .
4. Status post ileostomy without evidence of small-bowel obstruction .
5. Distended gallbladder .
6. Diverticulosis within the right remnant sigmoid colon .
03-21 VCUG - no leak
