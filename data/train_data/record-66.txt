History of Present Illness :
46 - yo-man w/ active cocaine use presents w/ LE edema .
10 days ago , he developed b/l LE edema that has gotten progressively worse until now .

Today , his wife convinced him to present to the Deanna for evaluation .
In the Deanna , his BP was 230/170 .
BNP was elevated at 7500 .
CXR revealed evidence of cardiomegaly and pulm edema .
He was treated w/ ASA 325 mg , lasix 10 mg IV , and hydralazine 10 mg IV x 2 .
He responded well to lasix w/ good UOP , but diastolic BP remained elevated at 170 , prompting initiation of nitroprusside gtt .
He is now admitted to the CCU for further care .

ALT(SGPT) - 77 * AST(SGOT) - 60 * CK(CPK) - 195 * ALK PHOS - 104 AMYLASE - 100 TOT BILI - 0.4
EKG demonstrated NSR at 87 bpm , nl axis , nl int , LVH w/ strain pattern , no ischemic changes .
CXR :
Moderate to severe enlargement of the cardiac silhouette , and  particularly the left atrium accompanied by pulmonary vascular congestion and mild pulmonary edema consistent with heart failure .
Conclusions :
The left atrium is moderately dilated .
There is moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with mild cavity dilation and severe global hypokinesis .
No left ventricular thrombus is seen .
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure ( PCWP > 18 mmHg ).
The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with severe free wall hypokinesis .
The aortic valve leaflets ( 3 ) are minimally thickened .
No aortic stenosis or aortic regurgitation is seen .
The mitral valve leaflets are structurally normal .
There is no mitral valve prolapse .
Mild ( 1+ ) mitral regurgitation is seen .
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension .
There is a very small circumferential pericardial effusion .
IMPRESSION : Moderate symmetric eft ventricular hypertrophy with severe global biventricular hypokinesis c/w diffuse process ( toxin , metabolic , cannot exclude myocarditis ; in the absence of LVH on ECG , an infiltrative process should also be considered ).
Mild mitral regurgitation .
Moderate pulmonary arterial hypertension .
Very small circumferential pericardial effusion .
Possible abnormality on the aortic valve as described above without aortic regurgitation .
If clinically indicated a TEE would be better able to define an abnormality of the aortic valve .
Brief Hospital Course :
46 - yo-man w/ cocaine abuse presents w/ LE edema and DOE likely from diastolic heart failure in the setting of cocaine use complicated by hypertensive urgency .
Hypertensive urgency :
BP 230/170 on presentation , most likely from chronic HTN exacerbated by cocaine use .
No signs of end-organ damage at present except for elevated creatinine , which is more likely a chronic problem .
The patient was started on labetalol and Lisinopril .
His blood pressure was taken down from 230 systolic to approx 160 systolic / 100 diastolic on discharge .
His lower extremity edema improved with diuresis .
An echo performed on admission showed an LF EF of 25% .
It is hoped with good blood pressure control and use of an ACE-I with follow up in addition to cocaine abstaining will improved his cardiac function .
Renal Failure : creatinine on admission was 1.6 Likely acute hypertensive nephropathy plus probalbe long-standing hypertensive disease .
discharged on ACE-I .
Substance Use : Social work saw patient and counceled him regarding substance abuse .
Discharged with Margaret Hallock , cardiology follow up as well as scheduled appointment with a new PCP @ Newton Health Center .
