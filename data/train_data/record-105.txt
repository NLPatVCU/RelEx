INDICATION :
Status post coronary bypass surgery .
There has been removal of a Swan-Ganz catheter and placement of a right internal jugular vascular catheter , with the tip terminating in the proximal right atrium just below the junction with the superior vena cava .
Cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable in the postoperative period .
Previously reported interstitial edema has resolved .
There has been interval improvement in left basilar atelectasis .
Right basilar atelectasis has slightly worsened .
Bilateral pleural effusions are unchanged .
IMPRESSION :
1. Vascular catheter tip terminates in proximal right atrium .
2. Bibasilar minor atelectasis , worse on the right and improved on the left .
Persistent pleural effusions .
