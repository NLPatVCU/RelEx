Relevant Imaging :
1) Bilateral LE doppler ( 06-14 ): No evidence of deep venous thrombosis in the lower extremities bilaterally .
2) Cxray ( 06-14 ): New bibasilar consolidations are demonstrated accompanied by bilateral small pleural effusion .
The lung volumes are slightly increased .
There is no pneumothorax identified .
3) CT Torso ( 06-17 ):
1. Marked interval enlargement of the cardiac silhouette .
Together with the interval development of bilateral pleural effusions , this indicates cardiac insufficiency ( or alternatively volume overload ) and an echocardiogram may be indicated for further evaluation .
2. Bilateral basilar compressive atelectasis .
Superimposed infectious consolidation is likely .
3. Interval development of tree-in-Eric nodular opacities and scattered ground glass opacities involving the right lung , concerning for an infectious process .
The differential diagnosis of this is wide including viral , fungal and atypical mycobacterial infections .
Drug toxicity would be a consideration , although somewhat less likely given the unilaterality of the findings .
4. New jejunal wall thickening with persistent distal ileal wall thickening and diffuse mesenteric stranding , most likely reflecting an infectious etiology .
5. Overall stability in metastatic burden .
4) ECHO ( 06-18 ): Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with preserved biventricular systolic function .
Mild posterior mitral valve prolapse with mild mitral regurgitation .
Small ( 0.6 cm ) circumferential pericardial effusion , largest around the left atrium .
5) L femur xray ( 06-18 ): Predominantly sclerotic lesion with interval periosteal new bone formation involving the intertrochanteric and subtrochanteric regions .
No displaced fracture is demonstrated .
Brief Hospital Course :
Mr. Mcelveen 51 year-old male with metastatic RCC on Sutent since 2018-12-21 , admitted with fever , hypoxemia , and bibasilar pneumonia .
1) Bibasilar pneumonia : Patient was treated for community-acquired pneumonia .
He was initially placed on Ceftriaxone , Levaquin , and Flagyl in the ICU but then changed to 
Azithromycin & CTX at time of transfer to the oncology service .
He continued to have an oxygen requirement and CT scan suggested ground glass opacities , suggestive of an underlying infectious process .
ECHO was done and confirmed normal ejection fraction .
His respiratory status improved slowly , oxygen was weaned off , and he was discharged on course of Levaquin .
2) Metastatic RCC : Sutent was held on admission in light of acute infection .
He underwent a staging CT scan torso which suggested no significant increase in tumor burden .
Patient was also found to have abnormal TFTs on Sutent and was started on replacement 
therapy .
He will need follow-up bloodwork as an outpatient .
Recent CT scan showed destruction of L femoral neck .
He underwent an xray of the L femur which did not suggest an acute fracture .
No limitations were placed in regards to weightbearing status .
Patient was instructed to restart Sutent next Monday .
3) Renal insufficiency : Creatinine improved from 2.1 to 1.3 at time of discharge .
Likely related to underlying malignancy as well as prerenal component given improvement with gentle hydration .
