Chief Complaint : fever
Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure :
Intubation for airway protection tunneled line change over wire 2019-01-08
History of Present Illness :
69 y/o female wtih PMH significant for ESRD on HD , type 2 DM , and recent PE resulting in PEA arrest admitted through the Juan with sepsis of unknown etiology .
Pt was recently admitted to The Hospital for Orthopedics from 12-07 thorugh 12-14 with hypotension thought to be secondary to overdiuresis at HD.
However , a septic component to the hypotension was also considered as the pt was found to have citrobacter in her urine and C diff in her stool .
Pt was then discharged to Arbour-Fuller Hospital Senior Life where she was in her normal state of health until three days ago .
Her son reports that she then developed a headache and fevers started three days ago which were treated with tylenol .
Then , this morning she developed fatigue and did not eat well .
He son also notes that she appeared to be working hard to breath .
She was found to be febrile to 101.9 and received levoflox and vancomycin .
Pt was then sent to the The Hospital for Orthopedics Juan for further evaluation .
Per notes , pt denied SOB , CP , and abdominal pain prior to intubation .
She did complain of a left frontal headache .
In the Juan , the pt 's VS were singificant for a fever of 103.8 , tachycardia in the 130s-150s , and initial hypertensive in the 140s .
Her oxygen saturation was 96% on RA but she was tachypneic to 31 .
She was obtunded and was thus intubated for airway protection .
Post-intubation , the pt 's BP acutely dropped to 58/19 in the setting of propofol .
When this medication was discontinued , her BP came back up to the 70s-90s / 30s-50s .
Pt was then initiated on the sepsis protocol .
In the Juan , she received vancomycin , levofloxacin , flagyl , and cefepime ( 2 gm ).
She received a total of 4 liters of NS then was started on levophed for continued hypotension .
Pt is now transferred to the FICU for further care .
Per pt 's son , she is bedbound at baseline due to her multiple LE femur fractures .
Past Medical History :
1. Type 2 diabetes mellitus
2. Diabetic nephropathy resulting in ESRD for which she is on HD .
Pt was due for HD but missed it secondary to her illness .
She normally receives HD on Mon , Wed , and Fri .
