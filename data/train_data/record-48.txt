Of note , the patient is admitted to hospital 3 times every month for similar complaints with last admission 1/20-2/1/07 .

In the CMED CCU he became hypotensive to SBP 80 s.
Labetalol was stopped and he received a 500 cc fluid bolus and his blood pressure rose to SBP 90 s.
Cardiac and infectious sources of hypotension were considered , but cardiac enzymes were not changed from prior studies and he had no localizing signs of infection ; blood cultures were sent and a ultrasound of the L arm AVF ordered to rule out abscess at the site .
He received a partial HD session , limited by hypotension .
Over night , his blood pressure trended up to 130 s systolic .

His blood sugar at 10 pm was low at 22 and he was disoriented , which resolved with two glasses of juice ; he did not receive his standing dose of NPH that evening .
Blood cultures returned positive with GPC in pairs and clusters , so a TTE and surveillance cultures were ordered and vancomycin was started .
He was then called out to the medical floor on 01-21 .
