Echo 02-09
1. The left atrium is moderately dilated .
The left atrium is elongated .
2. The left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal .
The left ventricular cavity size is normal .
There is mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction .
Overall left ventricular systolic function is mildly depressed .
Resting regional wall motion abnormalities include inferolateral , inferior and mid septal hypokinesis .
3. Right ventricular chamber size is normal .
Right ventricular systolic function is normal .
4. The aortic valve leaflets ( 3 ) are mildly thickened .
No aortic regurgitation present .
5. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened .
Moderate ( 2 +) mitral regurgitation is seen .
6. There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension .
7. There is no pericardial effusion .
Compared with the findings of the prior study ( tape reviewed ) of 2009-06-05 , the LV function has improved with an improvementt in function of the apex , septal and anterior walls .

Cath 2001
1. Coronary angiography demonstrated single vessel disease in a right dominant system .
The left main was normal .
The LAD had serial 90% lesions proximally , involving the origin of the first diagonal , which was occluded and filled via left to left collaterals .
The mid-distal LAD was underfilled initially but was without obstructive disease .
The non-dominant circumflex system had no hemodynamically significant stenoses .
The dominant RCA was a large vessel with no significant disease .
2. Resting hemodynamics revealed elevated right and left sided filling pressures with a mean RA pressure of 12 mm Hg and a mean wedge pressure 24 mm Hg .
Moderate pulmonary hypertension was present with a PA of 52/28 .
The cardiac index was preserved at 3.0 L / min / m2 .
3. Left ventriculography was not performed due to the presence of moderate renal insufficiency ( creatinine 1.6 ).
4. Successful PTCA and stenting of the proximal LAD with overlapping 2.25 x 13 mm and 2.25 x 18 mm Hepacoat stents with no residual stenosis or dissection and normal flow ( see PTCA comments ).
FINAL DIAGNOSIS :
1. One vessel coronary artery disease .
2. Moderately elevated right and left sided filling pressures .
3. Successful stenting of the proximal LAD .

RADIOLOGY Final Report
CT ABDOMEN W/O CONTRAST 2013-05-23 5:46 PM
CT ABDOMEN W/O CONTRAST ; CT PELVIS W/O CONTRAST
Reason : Please eval for perf / ischemic bowel
UNDERLYING MEDICAL CONDITION :
92 year old woman with MS changes , abd pain hypotension and bloody lavage on Lovenox+ASA
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION :
Please eval for perf / ischemic bowel
CONTRAINDICATIONS for IV CONTRAST : renal failure
INDICATION : 94-year-old woman with mental status changes , now with abdominal pain and hypertension .
TECHNIQUE : A multidetector scanner was used to obtain contiguous axial images from the lung bases to the pubic symphysis .
Neither IV nor oral contrast were used .
CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITHOUT IV CONTRAST : There are bilateral pleural effusions , right greater the left ; there is compressive atelectasis at the left lung base .
There are coronary vascular calcifications .
A nasogastric tube is seen coiling in the stomach .
A dual chamber pacemaker is seen with leads terminating in the right atrium and right ventricle .
Nasogastric tube is seen coiling in the stomach , with its tip at the pylorus .
Allowing for the limitations of this noncontrast study , the liver , pancreas , adrenals , stomach are unremarkable .
A 1.8 cm exophytic renal cyst is seen on the left .
A similar lesion is seen on the right , measuring 2.2 cm .
The aorta is normal in caliber , with vascular calcifications .
A small amount of free fluid is seen tracking around the liver , right pericolic gutter , along the mesentery and surrounding the right colon , which is collapsed .
A small amount of nondependent free air is seen in the anterior aspect of the abdomen .
The remainder of the bowel loops are fluid filled , and nondilated .
CT OF THE PELVIS WITHOUT IV CONTRAST : As previously noted , there is a small amount of free fluid surrounding the right colon , tracking along the mesentery and into the pelvis .
A small amount of free air is seen in the nondependent portion of the pelvis .
Vascular calcifications are seen in the abdominal aorta and iliac arteries .
Subcutaneous edema is noted in the lower abdomen and pelvis .
A catheter is seen entering the left inguinal region and coursing along the iliac vessels , terminating in the left pelvis .
Osseous structures are remarkable for degenerative changes of the spine , and a fracture of the proximal right humerus , with orthopedic hardware causing beam hardening artifact .
IMPRESSION :
1. A small amount of free air and free fluid in the pelvis and abdomen , mostly along the right pericolic gutter and surrounding the ascending colon , concerning for perforation .
Other bowel loops are unremarkable on this limited study .
This was discussed with Dr. Jason Long at approximately 6:30 p.m. , 2013-05-23 .
2. Bilateral pleural effusions , right greater than left , with left-sided compressive atelectasis .
3. Right proximal humeral fracture status post fixation .
The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist .

CT scan was obtained and this revealed free air and massive ascites .
Pt underwent surgery on 05-23
1. Exploratory laparotomy with drainage of intra-abdominal abscess and peritonitis with gross soilage with bile and gastric contents .
2. Exposure and wide drainage of perforated posterior duodenal ulcer with internal and external drainage .

4. Tube gastrostomy .
Continue to deteriorate spiking fevers with ventilatory support on pressors to hold the bp. with no improvement in mental staus was made CMO 5/20/5 .
