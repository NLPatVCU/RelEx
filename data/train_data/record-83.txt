Attending : Robert E Goldschmidt , M.D.
Addendum :
Just prior to discharge on 11-14 , pt 's BP was found to be 70/40 P70 s just after receiving her am BP meds .
She was asymptomatic .
The patient was kept in the hospital and the following issues were addressed :
1. Hypotension : The patient 'd pm BP meds were held 11-14 and she was administered 1.5L NS over the course of the day with subsequent SBP s in the high 90 s, low 100 s,.
The hypotension was likely due to volume depletion caused by her diarrhea / loose stools in addition to decreased PO intake secondary to her GERD and thrush .
All of this occurred in the setting of aggressive BP management with metoprolol 25 BID , HCTZ / Triampterene ( as a replacment for lasix due to recurrent hypokalemia ), Benicar 20 mg QD , and Imdur 30 mg QD .
Infection / sepsis was not likely given she was afebrile and had no localizing sx with an improving lung exam and 02 requirement .
Given the patient 's recent RP bleed , there was concern for a recurrent bleed .
Her groin exam was unchanged .
Her Hct dropped from Hct 38.9 before fluids to 35.5 s/p 1.5L NS and was thought to be dilutional .
Repeat hcts were stable .
The patient was kept an additional two days to follow her hcts and titrate her BP meds .
As volume depletion was thought to be the cause of her low BP , only the BBlocker was restarted .
She was also placed on on low dose spironolactone as a K sparing diuretic and for BP control in addition to Toprol XL 25 mg QD for her coronary disease .
She tolerated these meds with SBP s in the high 90 s to 100 s and was therefore discharged on this regimen .
She will need follow up with her PCP within B week after discharge from the extended care facility for further BP titration and monitoring of her electrolytes .
2. Thrush : This is likely secondary to her steroid inhalers and PO prednisone for COPD exacerbation .
She was started on nystatin swish and swallow QID .
The patient was encouraged to take PO liquids to prevent volume depletion .
3. diarrhea : The patient has been having loose stools at night and was guiac pos x 2 .
Stool for C.diff toxin was sent x 1 and was negative .
Her bowel regimen is prn .
Gastroenteritis is possible but she has no vomiting and only occ nausea with meds .
There is no evidence of obstruction on AXR .
Therefore , the cause of her mild diarrhea ( few loose BM / liquid stool / night ) may be either viral or secondary to resolving abdominal hematoma with resultant irritation of GI system .
We have advised a BRAT diet .
4. guiac pos stool : Given the patient 's sx of GERD , current PO steroid regimen , and ASA for her stents , the ddx for her guiac positive stools would include gastritis / gastric ulcer in addition to lower GI pathology .
However , she has no vomiting and only mild nausea with medications .
She also has no gross blood per rectum and her hct is stable .
Upon discharge the patient was changed to a BID protonix regimen .
Dr. Valerio office was notified about the patient 's discharge plans and status .
She will need outpatient follow up for her guiac pos stools with endoscopy vs EGD +/- H.pylori serologies .
A copy of this dc summary will be faxed to her PCP to ensure proper follow up .
