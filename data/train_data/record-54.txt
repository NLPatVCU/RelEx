CT C - SPINE W/O CONTRAST
2014-10-21 9:59 AM
CT C - SPINE W/O CONTRAST ; CT RECONSTRUCTION
Reason : 72 male s/p fall down 20 stairs
UNDERLYING MEDICAL CONDITION :
72 year old man with
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION :
72 male s/p fall down 20 stairs
CONTRAINDICATIONS for IV CONTRAST : None .
INDICATIONS : Fall down 20 stairs .
TECHNIQUE : Noncontrast cervical spine CT .
COMPARISON : None .
NOTE : This study was initially performed on 2014-10-21 .
Findings were discussed with Dr. Leanne Vazquez at the time this study was performed , but the study was not dictated until the morning of 2014-10-22 , due to PACS malfunction .
NONCONTRAST CERVICAL SPINE CT : There are minimally displaced and comminuted fractures through the left C7 and T1 transverse processes .
The margins do not appear to extend into the foramina transversaria .
Positioning limits assessment of alignment due to extreme head tilting to the right , but this is likely the best obtainable secondary to intubation and nasogastric tube placement .
Allowing for the limitations , the vertebral bodies are normal in height and normally aligned .
There is no atlantoaxial subluxation .
The lateral masses of C1 articulate normally about the odontoid process .
Prevertebral soft tissue swelling cannot be excluded secondary to intubation .
Extensive carotid arterial calcifications are present in the bulb regions bilaterally .
Biapical lung scarring and mild bronchiectasis are present .
Also noted is sclerosis and opacification of the visualized left mastoid air cells and mastoid tip , likely chronic inflammatory 
disease .
IMPRESSION : Minimally displaced , comminuted fractures of the left C7 and T1 transverse processes .
No evidence of extension into the foramina transversaria .
CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST
2014-10-21 9:42 AM
CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST
Reason : bleed ?
UNDERLYING MEDICAL CONDITION :
72 year old man with intraparenchymal bleed s/p fall
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION :
bleed ?
CONTRAINDICATIONS for IV CONTRAST : None .
INDICATION : Intraparenchymal hemorrhage after fall .
Assess for hemorrhage .
TECHNIQUE : Non-contrast head CT .
COMPARISON : No prior studies are available .
By report , the patient has an outside study .
Should this become available , an addendum will be issued to this report following the comparison with the outside examination .
NOTE : This study was initially performed on the morning of 10-21 , and is being dictated on the morning of 10-22 due to PACS malfunction .
Findings were called to Dr. Leanne Vazquez on the morning of 10-21 .
NON-CONTRAST HEAD CT : There is a small amount of hemorrhage within the occipital horns of both lateral ventricles , right greater than left .
Located within the atrium of the right lateral ventricle is an 18 x 10 mm nodular area of increased density which is separate from the choroid plexus .
There is no evidence of surrounding edema .
There is diffuse brain atrophy and chronic microvascular infarction throughout the white matter .
There is a remote right frontal infarct .
There is no evidence of subarachnoid hemorrhage or acute major vascular territorial infarction .
The ventricles do not appear dilated relative to the sulci , and there is no shift of normally midline structures .
There is no skull fracture .
There is opacification of the posterior nasal cavity and nasopharynx but an NG tube is present , and the patient is intubated .
Opacified and sclerotic left mastoid air cells are noted .
IMPRESSION :
1. Small amount of intraventricular hemorrhage .
2. Ovoid 18 - mm density within the atrium of the right lateral ventricle .
This could represent either an atypically located blood clot or an intraventricular mass , and further evaluation with contrast - enhanced MRI of the brain , when clinically feasible , is recommended .
Results were discussed with Dr. Leanne Vazquez in the early afternoon on 2014-10-21 .
CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST
2014-11-14 12:34 PM
CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST
Reason : altered mental status
UNDERLYING MEDICAL CONDITION :
72 year old man with
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION :
altered mental status
CONTRAINDICATIONS for IV CONTRAST : None .
INDICATION : 72-year-old male with altered mental status .
TECHNIQUE : Axial noncontrast CT scans of the brain were obtained .
Comparison is made to a previous study from 2014-10-27 .
FINDINGS :
There are numerous areas of decreased attenuation in the periventricular and subcortical white matter of both cerebral hemispheres , indicating chronic microvascular infarction .
There is also an old right frontal lobe cortical infarction .
A small right occipital lobe chronic infarction is also evident .
There is a small amount of blood layering in both lateral ventricles , and this has decreased since the previous study .
The size and shape of the ventricles is unchanged .
No new hemorrhage is observed .
There is opacification of the mastoid air cells , greater on the left than the right .
There is some fluid or mucosal thickening in the ethmoid and sphenoid sinuses .
IMPRESSION : No new cortical territorial infarction or hemorrhage is identified .
There is decreased intraventricular blood , compared to the previous study , and there are no signs of hydrocephalus .
CHEST ( PORTABLE AP )
2014-11-12 9:10 AM
CHEST ( PORTABLE AP )
Reason : Fever , f/u infiltrte
UNDERLYING MEDICAL CONDITION :
72 yo M with rib fx s/p trauma , failure on previous CXR , now with fever .
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION :
Fever , f/u infiltrte
HISTORY : Trauma , congestive heart failure , fever , pneumonia .
Portable supine chest radiograph shows improvement in edema compared to studies from four and five days earlier with no significant radiographic change in right upper lobe consolidation consistent with pneumonia .
Some interstitial edema still persists , but there is no central pulmonary vascular congestion .
Cardiac size is unchanged .
The amount of fluid layering at the apices and the pleural spaces appear slightly decreased .
Multiple left-sided rib fractures are seen .
Supporting tubes and lines are in unchanged position and the patient has a single lead pacemaker projected on the left .
Calcification is seen at both carotid bifurcations .
CONCLUSION : Improvement in congestion from edema with no worsening , but no significant improvement , in the right upper lobe pneumonia .
Supporting lines and tubes in unchanged position .
