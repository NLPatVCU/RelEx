The electrocardiogram showed atrial fibrillation with slow ventricular response and digitalis effect as well as left ventricular hypertrophy .
IMPRESSION ON ADMISSION :
Impression was that this was an 83-year-old female with cardiac history , dyspnea on exertion , increased calcium and hyperparathyroidism who presents for parathyroidectomy .
HOSPITAL COURSE AND TREATMENT :
On the day of admission , the patient was brought to the operating room for parathyroidectomy .
The right superior parathyroid gland was found to be markedly enlarged and consistent with an adenoma .
Her right superior parathyroid gland was removed and the rest of her parathyroid glands were left in place .
Postoperatively , the patient did well and was able to cough and phonate completely with no changes from preoperative .
The plan was to start her on heparin and Coumadin and discontinue her heparin when her Coumadin levels became therapeutic as judged by the prothrombin time / INR .
However , on postoperative day number two , the patient in the afternoon noticed some tingling in her hands and also some tingling hear her perioral region .
She had a negative Chvostek &apos;s and negative Trousseau &apos;s sign .
She had no muscular weakness noted .
An ionized calcium was drawn which was low at 1.0 .
As a result , the patient was started on Os-Cal 250 mg PO q.i.d. On postoperative day number three , her ionized calcium was 1.06 and her Os-Cal was increased to 500 q.i.d.
However , her ionized calcium decreased to 0.97 and she was given one amp of calcium gluconate .
On postoperative day number five , the patient felt fine and had an INR of 1.9 with a prothrombin time of 16.6 .
Her calcium was 8.5 , albumin 3.6 , and phosphate 4.5 .
She had had no further episodes of tingling in her fingers after the initial episode which had prompted us originally to draw the ionized calcium .
CONDITION ON DISCHARGE :
Good .
MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE :
1. Coumadin 5 mg PO q.day , then she will follow up with her primary care physician and decide the dosage thereafter ,
2. Lopid 600 mg PO b.i.d. ,

10. Glucotrol 10 mg qam .
FOLLOW UP :
For follow up , the patient is to call for an appointment with Dr. Sapmal .
In addition , she is to follow up with her primary care physician to check her prothrombin time / INR as well as calcium , albumin and phosphate levels .
She will be sent home with home Arnsperni Health .
