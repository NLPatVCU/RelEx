DISCHARGE SUMMARY 
NAME : 
LENKPRUSKIHKOOGLEKIH , NIEKERO C 
UNIT NUMBER : 
449-50-82 
ADMISSION DATE : 
12/25/96 
DISCHARGE DATE : 
12/29/96 
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS : 
Atrial fibrillation . 
ASSOCIATED DIAGNOSIS : 
History of multinodular goiter ; history of hypertension ; history of subtotal thyroidectomy . 
PRINCIPAL PROCEDURE : 
Electrical cardioversion . 
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS : 
Ms. Lenkpruskihkooglekih is a 63-year-old lady with a history of frequent premature ventricular contractions and infrequent short runs of non-sustained ventricular tachycardia ( one four-beat run ) in 1991 , for which several antiarrhythmic agents including Propranolol , Quinidine , Procainamide , Tenormin , Norpace , Corgard , and Flecainide were used , but were stopped because of intolerance . 
At that time , she had clear coronary arteries on coronary angiography and an ejection fraction greater than 50% . 
She did well off antiarrhythmic agents until October of this year when she was noted to have atrial fibrillation with a rapid ventricular rate after several days of decreased exercise tolerance . 
She was started on Coumadin and had a failed attempt at DC electrical cardioversion on 11/16/96 . 
She has been on Coumadin since and has continued to have occasional palpitations and mild shortness of breath . 
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY : 
Includes a history of hypertension ; multinodular goiter ; subtotal thyroidectomy . 
MEDICATIONS : 
Include Cardizem CD 180 mg daily ; Monopril 10 mg daily ; Digoxin .25 mg daily ; and Lasix 40 mg every other day . 
ALLERGIES : 
To Quinidine , Procardia , and sulfa antibiotics . 
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION : 
On examination , blood pressure was 200/100 ; heart rate 120 per minute ( atrial fibrillation ) . 
The patient was noted to be anxious . 
There was no neck vein distension or carotid bruits . 
Heart sounds were normal . 
The lungs were clear . 
The abdominal examination was benign . 
There was no peripheral edema . 
Pulses were all easily palpable . 
LABORATORY DATA : 
A 12-lead electrocardiogram showed atrial fibrillation with a QT interval of .46 seconds . 
There were diffuse ST segment and T-wave abnormalities , which were nonspecific . 
A complete blood count , electrolytes , BUN and creatinine were within normal limits . 
INR was elevated at 2.5 . 
An echocardiogram was performed , which showed completely normal left ventricular systolic function with an ejection fraction calculated at .74 . 
There was no evidence of left ventricular hypertrophy or asymmetric septal hypertrophy , which had been an issue that had been raised on an echocardiogram in Ownra Cin , New Mexico on 12/06/96 . 
HOSPITAL COURSE AND TREATMENT : 
The patient was started on Propafenone 300 mg three times a day and underwent an attempt at electrical cardioversion after seven doses of this . 
This failed , despite one shock at 300 joules and two shocks at 360 joules . 
The Propafenone was stopped , and the patient was changed to Amiodarone 400 mg t.i.d. , which was continued for two days . 
The patient was discharged to home on Amiodarone 200 mg daily on 12/29/96 . 
An electrocardiogram showed no evidence of QT prolongation prior to discharge , and pulmonary function tests will be performed before the patient goes home today . 
The patient will follow up with Dr. Ther Ludzjesc at Shiekeu Hospital Medical Centers in Connecticut . 
In addition , she will return to this hospital in early February for repeat attempt at electrical cardioversion on Amiodarone . 
She will continue her Coumadin until then and arrangements for her readmission can be made through Dr. Iceca Rhaltkaaispehbreun 's office here . 
MEDICATIONS : 
Other than the addition of Amiodarone 200 mg daily , will be the same as her admission medications .
