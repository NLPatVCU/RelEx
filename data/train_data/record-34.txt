5. Immunizations received - Hepatitis B vaccine given 2009-01-22 .
6. Immunizations recommended -
Synagis respiratory syncytial virus prophylaxis should be considered from October through April for infants who meet
any of the following three criteria -
1. Born at less than 32 weeks ;
2. Born between 32 and 35 weeks with plans for daycare during respiratory syncytial virus season , with a smoker in the household or with preschool siblings ; or
3. With chronic lung disease .
After some debate , we concluded that Vetrano was not at unusually high risk from RSV , but that her sister might be .
Vetrano probably does not need Synagis at least until her sibling is discharged from the hospital .
It may then be reasonable to treat both for the balance of the RSV season .
Influenza immunization should be considered annually in the fall for preterm infants with chronic lung disease once they
reach six months of age , before this age the family and other caregivers should be considered for immunization against
influenza to protect the infant .
7. Follow up - Follow up appointment with primary pediatrician within five days of discharge .
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS :
1. Prematurity , former 32 4/7 weeks , Twin #1
2. Rule out sepsis
