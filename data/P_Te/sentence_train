At the time of transfer  he was initially admitted to the CMI Service after undergoing cardiac catheterization which revealed a long LAD lesion that was angioplastied without stent placement  and a total occlusion of the RCA with collaterals 
He had a bedside transthoracic echocardiogram done in the Cardiac Catheterization laboratory without evidence of an effusion 
He subsequently became hypotensive and bradycardiac in the Catheterization Laboratory which responded to IV fluids  dopamine  Atropine  and he was then transferred to the CCU for further monitoring
